Note that if you would like to run the script as an app(executable), you should make a folder on your Desktop called "onboardingfolder".

1. Run the script or double click on the app.
2. Enter the username, Full Name and password for the new user.
3. The script will prompt for your password as well, the user running it, multiple times.
4. Allow whichever permission it requests.
5. Voila! Check the checklist for any errors.
