Note that if you would like to run the script as an app(executable), you should make a folder on your Desktop called "onboardingfolder", inside of which you would put the onboarding.sh file.

1. Run the script through your Terminal via the "./onboarding.sh" command or double click on the app.
2. Enter the username, Full Name and password for the new user.
3. The script might prompt for your password multiple times.
4. Allow whichever permission it requests.
5. Voila! Read the checklist for any errors.
